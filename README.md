Live wallpapers for Android made in Processing. 

Processing is an open-source software in which you can easily develop graphics (images and animations, but also event-based programs). It runs in either Java or Python, and makes visually expressing ideas through code both simple and intuitive. You can also make apps or live wallpapers for Android and export signed,  publish-ready apk's. 

You can find Processing at processing.org
