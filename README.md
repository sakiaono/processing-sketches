Live wallpapers for Android made in Processing. 

Processing is an open-source software in which you can easily develop graphics (images and animations, but also event-based programs). It runs in either Java or Python, and makes visually expressing ideas through code both simple and intuitive. 

You can find Processing at processing.org
